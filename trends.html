  <h1>Modern Practices and Trends in Version Control</h1>

  <h2>1. GitOps and DevOps Integration</h2>
  <p>
    GitOps applies Git principles to infrastructure management. Configuration files are versioned in Git, and changes
    are deployed automatically through Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Git is the single source of truth for both code and infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Pull requests enable peer review before deployment.</li>
    <li>Tools like ArgoCD and FluxCD automate syncing systems with repository state.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Cloud-Based Platforms</h2>
  <p>
    Services like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket make collaboration easier by adding features such as pull requests,
    issue tracking, and built-in CI/CD integration.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Over 100 million developers use GitHub as of 2023.</li>
    <li>Encourages “social coding” — sharing, forking, and contributing to projects globally.</li>
    <li>Combines code hosting, project management, and automation tools in one place.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Automation and AI in Code Review</h2>
  <p>
    Artificial Intelligence is increasingly assisting with code management and reviews. AI bots can detect bugs,
    suggest fixes, and even help resolve merge conflicts automatically.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Improves consistency and reduces human error.</li>
    <li>Provides insights into code quality and project health.</li>
    <li>Examples: GitHub Copilot and AI-powered review bots.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Collaborative Workflows</h2>
  <p>
    Modern workflows revolve around branching, pull requests, and automation. CI/CD pipelines test and deploy code
    whenever changes are merged, ensuring faster and more reliable software releases.
