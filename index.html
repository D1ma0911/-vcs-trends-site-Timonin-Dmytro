  <h1>Overview: History and Modern Trends in Version Control Systems</h1>

  <p>
    Version Control Systems (VCS) are tools that track changes in files, especially source code. They
    allow teams to collaborate, record a history of modifications, and revert to previous versions when needed.
  </p>

  <h2>What Are Version Control Systems?</h2>
  <p>
    VCS help developers work together efficiently, whether on local machines or through cloud platforms.
    They can be <strong>centralized</strong> (with one main repository) or <strong>distributed</strong>
    (each developer has a full copy of the project).
  </p>

  <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintains a full history of project changes.</li>
    <li>Enables collaboration among multiple contributors.</li>
    <li>Supports branching, merging, and experimentation safely.</li>
    <li>Forms the backbone of modern DevOps and automation pipelines.</li>
  </ul>
