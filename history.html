  <h1>Key Milestones in Version Control System History</h1>

  <h2>Historical Timeline</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>1972 – SCCS</strong>: One of the first systems, introduced file tracking at Bell Labs.</li>
    <li><strong>1982 – RCS</strong>: Automated versioning for single files using delta storage.</li>
    <li><strong>1986 – CVS</strong>: Enabled team collaboration through client–server repositories.</li>
    <li><strong>2000 – Subversion (SVN)</strong>: Improved CVS with atomic commits and better branching.</li>
    <li><strong>2005 – Git and Mercurial</strong>: Introduced distributed version control where every user has a full repo.</li>
    <li><strong>2008 – GitHub</strong>: Made Git social with pull requests and online collaboration.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>From Centralized to Distributed</h2>
  <p>
    Early systems like RCS, CVS, and SVN were centralized: a single repository managed the official code.
    This model was simple but fragile—if the server went down, work stopped.
  </p>

  <p>
    Distributed systems like Git and Mercurial changed everything: each developer has a complete copy of the repository,
    allowing offline work, faster branching, and flexible collaboration.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Distributed VCS Changed the Game</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Developers can work independently and merge later.</li>
    <li>Offline commits and backups of the full repository.</li>
    <li>Branching and merging became fast, safe, and encouraged experimentation.</li>
    <li>Facilitated large-scale collaboration (e.g., the Linux kernel project).</li>
  </ul>
